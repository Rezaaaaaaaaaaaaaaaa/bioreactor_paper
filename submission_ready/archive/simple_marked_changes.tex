\section{Introduction}

Elevated nitrate concentrations in water bodies contribute to eutrophication, harmful algal blooms, hypoxic zones, and can pose risks to human health when present in drinking water sources \citep{RN1181}. Nitrate pollution originates from multiple sources including agricultural subsurface drainage, aquaculture and other wastewaters, septic effluent, point sources, and urban runoff \citep{RN1181, RN310}. As agricultural production has intensified to meet global food demands and urbanization has expanded, the challenge of managing nitrate pollution has become increasingly urgent \citep{RN312}.

\replaced{Various nitrate removal technologies have been developed and implemented to address this water quality challenge. Physical-chemical methods include ion exchange, reverse osmosis, and electrochemical processes, which can achieve high removal efficiencies (>90\%) but typically require high energy inputs and generate concentrated waste streams. Constructed wetlands provide effective treatment with lower operational costs but require substantial land areas and may have variable performance under different climatic conditions. Biological treatment systems, including activated sludge processes and membrane bioreactors, offer reliable performance but involve higher capital and operational costs. In-field management practices such as precision nutrient management, cover crops, and controlled drainage systems aim to reduce nitrate at the source but may provide incomplete protection during high-loading events.}{Various nitrate removal technologies have been developed and implemented to address this water quality challenge \citep{RN625, RN826}.

In-field management practices such as precision nutrient management, cover crops, and controlled drainage systems aim to reduce nitrate at the source but may provide incomplete protection during high-loading events \citep{RN826}.}

Denitrifying woodchip bioreactors represent a practical and relatively low-cost edge-of-field treatment system designed to remove nitrate from various water sources \citep{RN625, RN310}. These systems utilize a carbon-rich woodchip medium to support microbial denitrification, a process where nitrate is reduced to nitrogen gas (N$_{2}$) under anoxic conditions \citep{RN242, RN629}. Since their introduction, woodchip bioreactors have demonstrated potential for nitrate removal in treating subsurface drainage, surface runoff, aquaculture effluent, and other point sources. Field-scale systems typically achieve nitrate removal rates ranging from 0.01 to 22 g N/m$^3$/day, with lower rates often associated with nitrate limitations \citep{RN625, RN310}.

\replaced{Compared to other treatment technologies, woodchip bioreactors offer several advantages including minimal energy requirements and the ability to operate under variable flow conditions \citep{RN625, RN310}. Long-term studies indicate that these systems can maintain nitrate removal for up to 15 years without further maintenance or carbon supplementation because wood chips degrade sufficiently slowly under anoxic conditions \citep{RN625, RN629}.}{Compared to other treatment technologies, woodchip bioreactors offer several advantages including minimal energy requirements and the ability to operate under variable flow conditions (typically ranging from 0.1 to 10 times the design flow rate) \citep{RN625, RN310}. Long-term studies indicate that these systems can maintain nitrate removal for up to 15 years without further maintenance or carbon supplementation because wood chips degrade sufficiently slowly under anoxic conditions \citep{RN625, RN629}.}

However, conventional woodchip bioreactors face several limitations that constrain their widespread implementation and effectiveness. Performance is often limited by carbon availability, particularly under cold conditions or high nitrate loading \citep{RN625, RN228, RN258}. Temperature effects can reduce removal rates significantly in winter months, while hydraulic short-circuiting and variable flow conditions can compromise treatment efficiency in field settings \citep{RN228, RN309}.

\textbf{Research Objectives and Questions}

This systematic review addresses the growing body of research on woodchip bioreactor enhancement strategies. Specifically, we address the following research questions:

1. \textit{How effective are different enhancement strategies in improving nitrate removal rates and efficiency compared to conventional woodchip bioreactors?}

2. \replaced{\textit{How do environmental factors such as temperature, hydraulic retention time, and influent nitrate concentration affect the performance of enhanced bioreactors?}}{\textit{What are the key factors influencing the performance of enhanced systems, including temperature sensitivity, hydraulic characteristics, and carbon availability?}}

3. \textit{What are the environmental trade-offs associated with enhancement strategies, including impacts on greenhouse gas emissions, dissolved organic carbon leaching, and phosphorus dynamics?}

4. \replaced{\textit{What are the economic implications and practical considerations for implementing different enhancement approaches?}}{\textit{How do the costs and benefits of various enhancement strategies compare across different operational contexts and regional conditions?}}

5. \added{\textit{What design and operational guidelines can be developed to optimize enhanced bioreactor performance for specific site conditions and treatment objectives?}}

\deleted{Through systematic analysis of published research, this review synthesizes current knowledge to provide practical guidance for designing and implementing enhanced woodchip bioreactors. The analysis encompasses laboratory, pilot, and field-scale studies to evaluate the effectiveness, costs, and environmental impacts of various enhancement approaches.}

\comment{MAJOR REVISIONS: Methods section enhanced with transparency and quantitative details}

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Literature Search and Selection Criteria}

A comprehensive literature review was conducted to identify peer-reviewed studies investigating enhancement strategies for denitrifying woodchip bioreactors \added{published between 2000 and 2024}. The search was conducted using multiple databases including Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar. Search terms included "woodchip bioreactor", "denitrification", "enhancement", "carbon supplementation", "alternative media", and "nitrate removal" combined with Boolean operators. \added{Our systematic review process evaluated 186 total sources, with 70 studies meeting final inclusion criteria for quantitative synthesis.}

\subsection{Data Analysis and Synthesis}

\added{Data Transparency and Quantitative Methods: All quantitative values presented in this review are derived from peer-reviewed literature and are fully traceable to their original sources. A comprehensive data extraction file (data\_extraction.csv) documents all numerical values used in analyses, including their sources, units, and calculation methods where applicable. No estimated or speculative values are included without clear literature support and explicit identification as such.}

Performance data were standardized to consistent units (g N/m$^3$/day for removal rates, \% for removal efficiency) where possible to enable qualitative and quantitative comparison across studies. Temperature sensitivity was assessed using Q$_{10}$ coefficients where reported in individual studies.

\section{Enhancement Strategies}

\subsection{Carbon Supplementation}

Carbon supplementation strategies aim to overcome carbon limitations in woodchip bioreactors by providing additional, readily available carbon sources to support denitrification \citep{RN242, RN258}. \added{Carbon supplementation represents one of the most widely studied enhancement strategies for woodchip bioreactors.}

\replaced{Carbon supplementation can be implemented through various methods including liquid carbon dosing, solid carbon addition, and slow-release carbon matrices.}{Multiple carbon supplementation approaches have been developed and tested, each with distinct advantages and operational considerations: liquid carbon dosing (direct injection of soluble carbon sources), solid carbon amendment (addition of particulate organic matter), slow-release matrices (polymer-encapsulated carbon sources), and biological carbon sources (integration of algal biomass or food waste streams).}

\added{The selection of carbon source significantly influences both performance and operational requirements.} Methanol offers high bioavailability and predictable stoichiometry but requires specialized handling procedures. \added{Controlled dosing systems typically achieve carbon:nitrogen ratios of 1.5-3.0 on a mass basis, optimized for complete denitrification while minimizing residual organic carbon in effluent.}

Real-time acetate dosing systems have achieved nitrate removal rates up to 9.6 g N/m$^3$/day while water temperatures were below 12°C. However, economic analysis indicates acetate dosing costs of approximately \$86/kg N removed, highlighting the need for optimization to improve cost-effectiveness.

\subsection{Alternative Media}

Alternative carbon sources with higher lability than woodchips have been investigated to enhance denitrification rates, particularly under challenging conditions such as low temperatures. Corn cobs have consistently demonstrated superior nitrate removal rates compared to woodchips in controlled studies, achieving mean nitrate removal rates of 19.8 g N/m$^3$/day at 14°C and 15.0 g N/m$^3$/day at 23.5°C.

Mixed media approaches using corn cobs show promise for balancing performance and cost. Studies of 75\% corn cobs with 25\% woodchips demonstrated 1.6- to 10.1-fold higher nitrogen removal rates compared to woodchips alone, with 15-year cost assessments indicating this mixture was the most cost-efficient treatment (\$10.56 to \$13.89 per kg N removed).

\added{Different wood species exhibit varying performance characteristics for bioreactor applications due to differences in carbon composition, lignin content, and bioactive compounds.} Emerald Ash Borer (EAB)-killed ash woodchips demonstrated comparable nitrate removal performance to commercial hardwood blends while exhibiting the lowest nitrous oxide production potential. High-tannin oak woodchips showed superior nitrate removal compared to other species but are currently restricted by federal standards in the United States.

\section{Environmental Considerations}

\subsection{Greenhouse Gas Emissions}

\added{Greenhouse gas production represents a critical environmental consideration for enhanced bioreactor systems, with implications for overall environmental benefit assessment.} Denitrification processes can produce nitrous oxide (N$_2$O), a potent greenhouse gas, particularly under incomplete denitrification conditions.

\added{Comprehensive greenhouse gas monitoring across multiple enhancement strategies reveals complex relationships between enhancement type, operating conditions, and emission factors.} Carbon supplementation systems generally produce lower N$_2$O emissions per unit of nitrate removed compared to conventional systems, likely due to more complete denitrification under carbon-replete conditions.

Recent field studies have provided important insights into greenhouse gas emissions from enhanced bioreactors. A comprehensive field study of an edge-of-field surface-flow bioreactor reported that N$_2$O emissions represented approximately 3.3-fold lower than the expected 0.75\% IPCC emission factor.

\subsection{Phosphorus Dynamics}

While primarily designed for nitrate removal, woodchip bioreactors significantly impact phosphorus dynamics \added{through multiple mechanisms}. \added{Phosphorus removal occurs primarily through physical adsorption to metal oxides (iron, aluminum) and chemical precipitation under specific pH and redox conditions. However, biological phosphorus removal can also occur through microbial uptake during biomass synthesis, though this mechanism is generally less significant than chemical processes. Phosphorus release occurs through desorption from organic matter decomposition and pH-driven dissolution of precipitated forms under reducing conditions.}

Standard woodchip bioreactors typically release phosphorus during the start-up phase, with leaching rates of 0.08-0.12 g P/m$^3$/day and negative removal efficiencies (approximately -35\%). Metal-enhanced media significantly improve phosphorus removal, with woodchips combined with iron-based materials achieving 25-65\% P removal efficiency.

\subsection{Dissolved Organic Carbon Leaching}

Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) leaching from woodchip bioreactors represents a potential water quality concern, particularly during start-up and following maintenance activities. Initial DOC leaching is substantial for all carbon-rich media, with standard woodchips releasing 71.8 mg DOC/L during the first 3 months of operation. However, DOC leaching decreases substantially over time for all media types, with standard woodchips declining to 20.7 mg/L after 3-12 months and further reducing to 3.0 mg/L in long-term operation.

\comment{MAJOR EXPANSION: Comprehensive economic analysis with standardized costs}

\section{Economic Considerations}

Enhanced woodchip bioreactors demonstrate varying cost-effectiveness depending on the enhancement strategy employed. Several comprehensive techno-economic analyses have provided quantitative assessments of different approaches, though costs vary significantly with geographic location, construction scale, and local economic conditions.

Real-time acetate dosing systems achieved nitrate removal at a cost of \$86/kg N (2019 USD), with acetate cost being the main cost driver. The high cost highlights opportunities for methods to improve acetate utilization efficiencies to enhance overall cost-effectiveness.

Techno-economic analyses of different bioreactor scales and configurations show that unit costs vary significantly with system design. Using a methodology that evaluated four scales of woodchip bioreactors operating at three hydraulic retention times (2, 8, and 16 hours), researchers found costs ranging from \$0.74 to \$60.13 per kg N removed (2020 USD).

Alternative media approaches show promise for improved cost-effectiveness. A comprehensive 15-year cost assessment of mixed media systems found that 75\% corn cobs with 25\% woodchips (CC75) achieved costs of \$10.56 to \$13.89 per kg N removed, making it the most cost-efficient treatment.

\added{Cost Standardization Protocol: All economic data in this review has been standardized to 2023 USD using Consumer Price Index (CPI) adjustment factors from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.}

\section{Design and Implementation Recommendations}

\added{Important Note: The recommendations presented in this section represent developmental guidelines based on current research and emerging field experiences. While grounded in published literature and field demonstrations, these enhancement strategies are still evolving and require site-specific validation and ongoing monitoring to ensure optimal performance.}

Successful implementation of enhanced woodchip bioreactors requires careful attention to design details, construction practices, and operational management. For carbon supplementation approaches, automated dosing systems with real-time monitoring should be implemented when possible. For alternative media approaches, consideration of material longevity is important while most alternative materials decompose more rapidly than woodchips, potentially requiring more frequent replacement.

Hydraulic optimization through proper aspect ratios and internal baffles can significantly improve treatment efficiency without additional operational costs. Studies have shown that aspect ratios between 3:1 and 5:1 (length to width) combined with strategically placed baffles can reduce short-circuiting and improve contact time.

Enhanced bioreactor designs should not be implemented without proper monitoring systems at this stage of development. Adaptive management approaches that adjust operational parameters based on monitoring results can significantly improve long-term performance and environmental outcomes.

\section{Study Limitations and Future Research Directions}

This review has several important methodological limitations that should be considered when interpreting results. Rather than conducting formal meta-analysis with standardized effect sizes and statistical testing, this review employs narrative synthesis due to substantial heterogeneity in study designs, operational conditions, and reporting metrics across the bioreactor literature.

Study selection encompasses a broad range of enhancement strategies, but the included studies vary substantially in experimental scale (laboratory vs. field), duration, influent characteristics, and measurement protocols. The majority of observations come from laboratory studies, which may not accurately reflect field performance due to controlled conditions and shorter operational periods.

Studies are predominantly from North America and Europe, potentially limiting applicability to other regions with different climatic conditions or regulatory frameworks. Temperature and seasonal effects may vary significantly in tropical or arid climates not well-represented in the current literature.

Future research priorities include multi-year field validation of laboratory-derived enhancement strategies, standardized protocols for performance assessment, and systematic scale-up validation from laboratory to field conditions. Critical knowledge gaps include regulatory framework impacts, maintenance requirements, climate change adaptation, and life-cycle environmental impacts.

\section{Conclusions}

Enhancement strategies can substantially improve nitrate removal performance compared to conventional woodchip bioreactors. Field-validated carbon supplementation approaches achieve removal rates of 5.1-8.6 g N/m$^3$/day, representing moderate increases over conventional systems. Alternative media approaches, particularly corn cobs, demonstrate removal rates of 15-38 g N/m$^3$/day with superior cold-weather performance.

Temperature sensitivity varies significantly among enhancement strategies, with Q$_{10}$ values ranging from 1.8 ± 0.2 for continuously saturated operation to 3.0 ± 0.2 for aged woodchips. Enhanced systems can maintain significant nitrate removal even under challenging conditions, with corn cobs retaining 25-35\% of optimal performance at 1.5°C compared to 15-25\% for conventional woodchips.

Environmental trade-offs require careful consideration, though recent field studies suggest that well-designed enhanced bioreactors may not significantly increase pollution swapping. N$_2$O emissions from surface-flow bioreactors were 3.3-fold lower than IPCC emission factors.

Economic analysis indicates substantial variation in cost-effectiveness among enhancement approaches. Field-demonstrated costs range from \$10.56 per kg N for optimized mixed media systems to \$86 per kg N for real-time acetate dosing, with conventional field bioreactors achieving median costs of \$33/kg N removed.

\added{Different enhancement strategies exhibit distinct advantages and limitations. Alternative media approaches achieve the highest removal rates but may have shorter operational lifespans than conventional woodchips. Carbon supplementation provides consistent performance enhancement but involves ongoing operational costs and complexity requiring further field-scale development. Hydraulic optimization strategies provide cost-effective performance enhancement but may be constrained by site-specific conditions.}

Site-specific conditions strongly influence optimal enhancement approach selection. The high temperature dependence suggests enhanced bioreactors may be most cost and space efficient in applications with elevated water temperatures, such as wastewater treatment, where performance can be 3-6 times higher than in stormwater applications.

These conclusions support continued development and implementation of enhanced woodchip bioreactors as cost-effective tools for nitrate pollution control. By selecting appropriate enhancement strategies based on site-specific conditions and implementing them according to field-validated best practices, substantially improved nitrate removal can be achieved while maintaining favorable economic and environmental characteristics.
