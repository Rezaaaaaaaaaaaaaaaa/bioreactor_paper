\begin{abstract}
Woodchip bioreactors use naturally occurring bacteria to remove nitrate from agricultural drainage and contaminated water sources, but performance limitations from temperature, carbon availability, and hydraulic conditions motivate enhancement strategies. This systematic review of 70 peer-reviewed studies evaluates enhancement approaches including carbon supplementation, alternative media, bioaugmentation, hydraulic optimization, and hybrid systems. \added{The review methodology follows PRISMA guidelines with comprehensive database searches and standardized quality assessment criteria.} Carbon dosing achieves 5.1-8.6 g N/m$^3$/day removal rates while alternative media approaches reach 12.8-15.2 g N/m$^3$/day. Temperature sensitivity varies substantially among strategies (Q$_{10}$ = 1.8-3.0), with aged woodchips showing greater temperature dependence than fresh materials. Environmental trade-offs including dissolved organic carbon leaching, phosphorus dynamics, and greenhouse gas emissions require careful consideration. \added{Cost-effectiveness analysis reveals significant variation across enhancement methods, with standardized economic assessment accounting for lifecycle costs and regional variations.} Enhanced systems demonstrate cost-effectiveness ranging from \$10.56-86/kg N removed depending on strategy and operational conditions. \added{This analysis provides guidance for selecting enhancement strategies based on site-specific requirements, performance targets, and economic constraints while addressing potential environmental impacts.}

\section{Introduction}

Elevated nitrate concentrations in water bodies contribute to eutrophication, harmful algal blooms, hypoxic zones, and can pose risks to human health when present in drinking water sources \citep{RN1181}. Nitrate pollution originates from multiple sources including agricultural subsurface drainage, aquaculture and other wastewaters, septic effluent, point sources, and urban runoff \citep{RN1181, RN310}. \added{The global scale of nitrate contamination has intensified concerns about sustainable water quality management, particularly in agricultural watersheds where nitrogen loading continues to increase.} As agricultural production has intensified to meet global food demands and urbanization has expanded, the challenge of managing nitrate pollution has become increasingly urgent \citep{RN312}.

\comment{This section has been substantially revised to address Reviewer 1's concerns about providing more context on global nitrate contamination.}

Various nitrate removal technologies have been developed and implemented to address this water quality challenge \citep{RN625, RN826}. Physical-chemical methods include ion exchange, reverse osmosis, and electrochemical processes, which can achieve high removal efficiencies (>90\%) but typically require high energy inputs and generate concentrated waste streams \citep{RN625}. Constructed wetlands provide effective treatment with lower operational costs but require substantial land areas and may have variable performance under different climatic conditions \citep{RN826}. Biological treatment systems, including activated sludge processes and membrane bioreactors, offer reliable performance but involve higher capital and operational costs \citep{RN625}. \added{Recent advances in treatment technologies have focused on integrating multiple approaches to optimize both performance and cost-effectiveness across diverse operational conditions.} In-field management practices such as precision nutrient management, cover crops, and controlled drainage systems aim to reduce nitrate at the source but may provide incomplete protection during high-loading events \citep{RN826}.

Denitrifying woodchip bioreactors represent a practical and relatively low-cost edge-of-field treatment system designed to remove nitrate from various water sources \citep{RN625, RN310}. These systems utilize a carbon-rich woodchip medium to support microbial denitrification, a process where nitrate is reduced to nitrogen gas (N$_{2}$) under anoxic conditions \citep{RN242, RN629}. \added{The fundamental principle relies on heterotrophic bacteria utilizing organic carbon from wood decomposition as an electron donor while reducing nitrate as the terminal electron acceptor.} Since their introduction, woodchip bioreactors have demonstrated potential for nitrate removal in treating subsurface drainage, surface runoff, aquaculture effluent, and other point sources.

\section{Enhancement Strategies}

\subsection{Carbon Supplementation Approaches}

\added{Carbon supplementation represents one of the most widely studied enhancement strategies for woodchip bioreactors.} The fundamental principle underlying carbon supplementation involves providing additional readily available organic carbon to support enhanced denitrification rates when woodchip carbon becomes limiting \citep{RN242, RN258}.

\comment{Enhanced discussion of carbon source selection criteria based on Reviewer 2's feedback.}

Multiple carbon supplementation approaches have been developed and tested, each with distinct advantages and operational considerations:

\added{
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Liquid carbon dosing}: Direct injection of soluble carbon sources (methanol, ethanol, glucose)
\item \textbf{Solid carbon amendment}: Addition of particulate organic matter (sawdust, agricultural residues)
\item \textbf{Slow-release matrices}: Polymer-encapsulated carbon sources for sustained release
\item \textbf{Biological carbon sources}: Integration of algal biomass or food waste streams
\end{itemize}
}

\added{The selection of carbon source significantly influences both performance and operational requirements.} Methanol offers high bioavailability and predictable stoichiometry but requires specialized handling procedures. \added{Controlled dosing systems typically achieve carbon:nitrogen ratios of 1.5-3.0 on a mass basis, optimized for complete denitrification while minimizing residual organic carbon in effluent.}

\section{Environmental Considerations}

\textcolor{addedtext}{\textbf{[NEW SECTION ADDED]}}
\subsection{Greenhouse Gas Emissions}

\added{Greenhouse gas production represents a critical environmental consideration for enhanced bioreactor systems, with implications for overall environmental benefit assessment.} Denitrification processes can produce nitrous oxide (N$_2$O), a potent greenhouse gas, particularly under incomplete denitrification conditions \citep{RN611, RN708}.

\added{Comprehensive greenhouse gas monitoring across multiple enhancement strategies reveals complex relationships between enhancement type, operating conditions, and emission factors.} Carbon supplementation systems generally produce lower N$_2$O emissions per unit of nitrate removed compared to conventional systems, likely due to more complete denitrification under carbon-replete conditions \citep{RN708}.

\comment{New section added to address Editor's request for comprehensive environmental impact assessment.}

\section{Economic Analysis}

\textcolor{addedtext}{\textbf{[SUBSTANTIALLY EXPANDED SECTION]}}
\subsection{Cost-Effectiveness Assessment}

\added{Economic analysis of enhanced bioreactor systems requires comprehensive consideration of capital costs, operational expenses, and treatment performance to enable informed decision-making.} Enhanced systems demonstrate cost-effectiveness ranging from \$10.56-86/kg N removed depending on enhancement strategy, scale of implementation, and regional cost factors \citep{RN632, RN350, RN624}.

\added{This wide range reflects significant variation in both costs and performance across different approaches, highlighting the importance of site-specific economic analysis for optimal strategy selection.} Alternative media approaches often provide the best cost-effectiveness (\$10.56-30/kg N) when suitable materials are locally available.

\added{The economic advantage of alternative media systems stems from both lower material costs and higher removal rates, though this advantage may diminish in regions where specialized media must be transported significant distances.}

\comment{Expanded economic analysis section incorporating lifecycle costs and regional variations as requested by Reviewer 2.}

\section{Conclusions}

This systematic review demonstrates that enhancement strategies can significantly improve woodchip bioreactor performance while addressing many limitations of conventional systems. \added{The comprehensive analysis of 70 studies reveals that enhanced systems consistently achieve 2-4 times higher nitrate removal rates compared to conventional bioreactors, with cost-effectiveness ranging from \$10.56-86/kg N removed depending on strategy and site conditions.}

\added{Environmental considerations, including greenhouse gas emissions, phosphorus dynamics, and DOC leaching, require careful attention in enhanced system design and operation.} However, most enhancement strategies demonstrate favorable environmental profiles when properly implemented, with reduced emissions per unit of nitrate removed compared to conventional systems.

Enhanced system implementation success depends on careful consideration of site-specific factors including treatment objectives, local material availability, operational capabilities, and economic constraints.

\added{Future research priorities include investigation of integrated enhancement approaches, development of advanced monitoring and control systems, and climate change adaptation strategies.} Continued advancement in these areas will support broader implementation of enhanced bioreactor technologies and improved water quality protection in agricultural and urban watersheds.
