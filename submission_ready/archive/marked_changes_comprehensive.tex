\section{Introduction}

Elevated nitrate concentrations in water bodies contribute to eutrophication, harmful algal blooms, hypoxic zones, and can pose risks to human health when present in drinking water sources \citep{RN1181}. Nitrate pollution originates from multiple sources including agricultural subsurface drainage, aquaculture and other wastewaters, septic effluent, point sources, and urban runoff \citep{RN1181, RN310}. As agricultural production has intensified to meet global food demands and urbanization has expanded, the challenge of managing nitrate pollution has become increasingly urgent \citep{RN312}.

\changed{Various nitrate removal technologies have been developed and implemented to address this water quality challenge. Physical-chemical methods include ion exchange, reverse osmosis, and electrochemical processes, which can achieve high removal efficiencies (>90\%) but typically require high energy inputs and generate concentrated waste streams. Constructed wetlands provide effective treatment with lower operational costs but require substantial land areas and may have variable performance under different climatic conditions. Biological treatment systems, including activated sludge processes and membrane bioreactors, offer reliable performance but involve higher capital and operational costs. In-field management practices such as precision nutrient management, cover crops, and controlled drainage systems aim to reduce nitrate at the source but may provide incomplete protection during high-loading events.}{Various nitrate removal technologies have been developed and implemented to address this water quality challenge \citep{RN625, RN826}.

In-field management practices such as precision nutrient management, cover crops, and controlled drainage systems aim to reduce nitrate at the source but may provide incomplete protection during high-loading events \citep{RN826}.}

Denitrifying woodchip bioreactors represent a practical and relatively low-cost edge-of-field treatment system designed to remove nitrate from various water sources \citep{RN625, RN310}. These systems utilize a carbon-rich woodchip medium to support microbial denitrification, a process where nitrate is reduced to nitrogen gas (N$_{2}$) under anoxic conditions \citep{RN242, RN629}. Since their introduction, woodchip bioreactors have demonstrated potential for nitrate removal in treating subsurface drainage, surface runoff, aquaculture effluent, and other point sources. Field-scale systems typically achieve nitrate removal rates ranging from 0.01 to 22 g N/m$^3$/day, with lower rates often associated with nitrate limitations \citep{RN625, RN310}.

\changed{Compared to other treatment technologies, woodchip bioreactors offer several advantages including minimal energy requirements and the ability to operate under variable flow conditions \citep{RN625, RN310}. Long-term studies indicate that these systems can maintain nitrate removal for up to 15 years without further maintenance or carbon supplementation because wood chips degrade sufficiently slowly under anoxic conditions \citep{RN625, RN629}.}{Compared to other treatment technologies, woodchip bioreactors offer several advantages including minimal energy requirements and the ability to operate under variable flow conditions (typically ranging from 0.1 to 10 times the design flow rate) \citep{RN625, RN310}. Long-term studies indicate that these systems can maintain nitrate removal for up to 15 years without further maintenance or carbon supplementation because wood chips degrade sufficiently slowly under anoxic conditions \citep{RN625, RN629}.}

However, conventional woodchip bioreactors face several limitations that constrain their widespread implementation and effectiveness. Performance is often limited by carbon availability, particularly under cold conditions or high nitrate loading \citep{RN625, RN228, RN258}. Temperature effects can reduce removal rates significantly in winter months, while hydraulic short-circuiting and variable flow conditions can compromise treatment efficiency in field settings \citep{RN228, RN309}. Additionally, space constraints, cost considerations, and the need for higher removal rates to meet water quality targets have motivated research into enhancement strategies.

\textbf{Research Objectives and Questions}

This systematic review addresses the growing body of research on woodchip bioreactor enhancement strategies. Specifically, we address the following research questions:

1. \textit{How effective are different enhancement strategies in improving nitrate removal rates and efficiency compared to conventional woodchip bioreactors?}

2. \changed{\textit{How do environmental factors such as temperature, hydraulic retention time, and influent nitrate concentration affect the performance of enhanced bioreactors?}}{\textit{What are the key factors influencing the performance of enhanced systems, including temperature sensitivity, hydraulic characteristics, and carbon availability?}}

3. \textit{What are the environmental trade-offs associated with enhancement strategies, including impacts on greenhouse gas emissions, dissolved organic carbon leaching, and phosphorus dynamics?}

4. \changed{\textit{What are the economic implications and practical considerations for implementing different enhancement approaches?}}{\textit{How do the costs and benefits of various enhancement strategies compare across different operational contexts and regional conditions?}}

5. \added{\textit{What design and operational guidelines can be developed to optimize enhanced bioreactor performance for specific site conditions and treatment objectives?}}

\deleted{Through systematic analysis of published research, this review synthesizes current knowledge to provide practical guidance for designing and implementing enhanced woodchip bioreactors. The analysis encompasses laboratory, pilot, and field-scale studies to evaluate the effectiveness, costs, and environmental impacts of various enhancement approaches.}
