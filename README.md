## Key Changes Made

### 🔬 **Manuscript Improvements**
- **Enhanced methodology**: Added literature search time range (2000-2024)
- **Expanded mechanisms**: Detailed denitrification enzymatic pathways
- **Quantitative data**: Added specific performance metrics and thresholds
- **Wood species analysis**: Comprehensive discussion of different wood types
- **Environmental impacts**: Mechanistic explanations for GHG and phosphorus dynamics

### 📊 **Figure Enhancements** 
- **Lab vs. field differentiation**: Stacked bars showing experimental scale differences
- **Improved clarity**: Fixed overlapping legends and increased font sizes
- **Unit corrections**: Fixed DOC units to mg C/L as requested
- **New cost analysis**: Added Figure 5 comparing bioreactor configurations
- **Enhanced visualizations**: Better colors, positioning, and readability

### 📋 **Response Document**
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Addresses all 55+ reviewer comments from 6 reviewers
- **Systematic organization**: Comments organized by reviewer and round
- **Specific changes**: Documents exact modifications made to address each point
- **Justifications**: Explains rationale where changes weren't made
