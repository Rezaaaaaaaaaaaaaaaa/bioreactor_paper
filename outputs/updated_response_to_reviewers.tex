\textbf{Response:} We have substantially refined the abstract to improve clarity and reduce wordiness while maintaining all essential content. The revised abstract is more concise (~150 words vs. previous ~200 words) and uses clearer, more direct language.

\textbf{Changes made:} 
\begin{itemize}
\item Condensed introduction from two sentences to one
\item Streamlined methodology description
\item Combined performance results into more concise statements
\item Simplified technical language while maintaining precision
\item Added economic cost range for comprehensive summary
\end{itemize}

\subsection{References and Citations Corrections}
\textbf{Requirement:} "Double-check that all references are relevant and correctly applied. Ensure adequate citations support the arguments throughout the paper."

\textbf{Response:} We conducted a comprehensive review and correction of all citations, identifying and fixing several critical errors.

\textbf{Changes made:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Critical Error Fixed:} Corrected incorrect citation of carbon dosing data (5.1-8.6 g N/m$^3$/day) from RN239 (Aalto et al.) to RN632 (Moghaddam et al.) - this was a significant error affecting multiple locations in the manuscript
\item \textbf{Added Missing References:} Added appropriate citations for hydrolysis mechanisms discussion (lines 158-160) citing RN625, RN242, and RN629
\item \textbf{Verified All Citations:} Conducted systematic check of all \textbackslash citep\{\} commands for accuracy and relevance
\item \textbf{Enhanced Literature Support:} Added additional references to strengthen economic analysis in Section 6
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Units and Consistency Standardization}
\textbf{Requirement:} "Standardize units across sections. Example: In the Acetate Supplementation section, removal rates are expressed in mg NO$_3^-$-N/L/h, but other sections use different formats."

\textbf{Response:} We have standardized all removal rate units to g N/m$^3$/day throughout the manuscript for consistency.

\textbf{Changes made:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Acetate Section:} Converted 0.4 mg NO$_3^-$-N/L/h to 9.6 g N/m$^3$/day with explanatory conversion note
\item \textbf{Systematic Check:} Verified all other rate expressions use consistent g N/m$^3$/day format
\item \textbf{Economic Units:} Confirmed all cost data uses consistent \$/kg N removed format with standardized 2023 USD
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Figures and Captions Enhancement}
\textbf{Requirement:} "Figure 5: There appears to be an overlapping/hidden caption—fix layout. Figure 6: Expand explanation. Figure 9: Add proper equations and clarify DOC concentrations."

\textbf{Response:} We have enhanced all figure captions with expanded explanations and added technical details as requested.

\textbf{Changes made:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Figure 6 (Greenhouse Gas):} Expanded caption to explain practical applications of HRT optimization, emphasizing design guidance for enhanced systems and importance for carbon supplementation applications
\item \textbf{Figure 9 (Wood Species):} Added performance equation: Removal Rate = k$_{species}$ $\times$ [tannin content]$^{0.3}$ $\times$ f(temperature), included DOC leaching values (2.5-3.1 mg P/L), and added mitigation discussion
\item \textbf{Figure 5 (Cost Analysis):} Verified layout - no overlapping caption issues found in current version
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Content Additions}

\subsubsection{Section 5.2: Greenhouse Gas Emission Mitigation}
\textbf{Requirement:} "Add a brief discussion of greenhouse gas emission mitigation approaches in bioreactors (not too detailed)."

\textbf{Response:} We have added a comprehensive but concise subsection on greenhouse gas mitigation strategies within Section 5.2.

\textbf{Changes made:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Added \textbf{"Greenhouse Gas Mitigation Strategies"} subsection with five key approaches:
\item Hydraulic retention time optimization (8-16 hours optimal range)
\item Carbon dosing management (C:N ratio of 2-4:1)
\item Temperature control strategies for reducing N$_2$O emissions above 15°C
\item Design modifications for proper sealing and oxygen exclusion
\item Flow management to avoid stagnant conditions
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Section 6: Economic Considerations Enhancement}
\textbf{Requirement:} "Strengthen with more literature support."

\textbf{Response:} We have substantially strengthened the economic analysis with additional literature support and comprehensive cost-effectiveness analysis.

\textbf{Changes made:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Added \textbf{"Comparative Cost-Effectiveness Analysis"} comparing bioreactor costs with other agricultural treatments (constructed wetlands: \$15-60/kg N; precision management: \$5-25/kg N)
\item Added \textbf{"Lifecycle Economic Considerations"} discussing maintenance cycles, media replacement schedules, and system degradation over 20-25 year lifespan
\item Enhanced with additional references (RN310, RN348, RN605) for comprehensive economic assessment
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Section 6.5: Purpose Clarification}
\textbf{Requirement:} "Clarify the purpose of this subsection—what insight does it add?"

\textbf{Response:} We have added a clear purpose statement explaining the importance of this section for decision-making.

\textbf{Changes made:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Added \textbf{"Purpose and Insights"} paragraph explaining that this section provides critical transparency about economic data interpretation
\item Emphasized importance for practitioners and policymakers making investment decisions
\item Clarified role in establishing standardized framework for cost comparisons across enhancement strategies
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Section 7: Implementation Recommendations Enhancement}
