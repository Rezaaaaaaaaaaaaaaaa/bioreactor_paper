Highlights

• Systematic review of 70 studies evaluates enhancement strategies for woodchip bioreactors treating nitrate-contaminated water

• Carbon supplementation achieves 5.1-8.6 g N/m³/day removal rates while alternative media approaches reach 12.8-15.2 g N/m³/day  

• Temperature sensitivity varies substantially among strategies (Q₁₀ = 1.8-3.0), with aged woodchips showing greater dependence than fresh materials

• Enhanced systems demonstrate cost-effectiveness ranging from $10.56-86/kg N removed depending on strategy and operational conditions

• Comprehensive mitigation strategies address environmental trade-offs including greenhouse gas emissions, DOC leaching, and phosphorus dynamics

• Economic analysis reveals lifecycle considerations and comparative performance against conventional agricultural treatment options
