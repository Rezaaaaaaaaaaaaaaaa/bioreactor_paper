Highlights

• Systematic review of 70 studies on enhanced woodchip bioreactor strategies
• Alternative media achieve 12.8-15.2 g N/m³/day vs 5.1-8.6 for carbon addition
• Temperature sensitivity varies by strategy (Q₁₀ = 1.8-3.0) with aged chips
• Cost-effectiveness ranges $10.56-86/kg N removed across enhancement methods
• Mitigation strategies address GHG emissions, DOC leaching, P dynamics trade-offs
