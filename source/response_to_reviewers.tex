\section*{Introduction}

We thank the editors and reviewers for their thorough and constructive feedback on our manuscript. We have carefully considered all comments and have made substantial revisions to address the concerns raised. Below we provide a detailed response to each reviewer comment, indicating the specific changes made to the manuscript and figures.

\section{Reviewer \#1 - Round 1 Comments}

\subsection{Comment 1.1: Novelty of the study}
\textbf{Reviewer comment:} "The authors mention that there is extensive existing research on woodchip bioreactors, but the novelty of this study is not sufficiently highlighted. It is recommended to clearly articulate the distinctive contributions that set this work apart from previous studies."

\textbf{Response:} We have strengthened the novelty statement in the abstract and introduction by clarifying that this is the first comprehensive synthesis to quantitatively compare enhancement strategies across experimental scales while systematically addressing environmental trade-offs. The abstract now explicitly states the systematic nature of our approach and the unique focus on enhancement strategies rather than conventional bioreactor reviews.

\textbf{Changes made:} Modified abstract to emphasize systematic review of 70 studies with quantitative comparison across enhancement strategies.

\subsection{Comment 1.2: Literature search time range}
\textbf{Reviewer comment:} "Section 2.1, 'Literature Search and Screening Criteria,' does not specify the time range of the literature search. This should be clarified."

\textbf{Response:} We have added the specific time range for our literature search.

\textbf{Changes made:} Added "published between 2000 and 2024" to Section 2.1 in the literature search description.

\subsection{Comment 1.3: Laboratory vs. field data differentiation}
\textbf{Reviewer comment:} "Figure 1 combines laboratory and field data but does not differentiate or weight them. A direct comparative analysis between laboratory and field data in the figure is recommended."

\textbf{Response:} We have modified Figure 1 to show laboratory and field data as separate stacked components within each enhancement strategy, providing visual differentiation between experimental scales.

\textbf{Changes made:} Updated Figure 1 (fig1\_removal\_rates\_scientific.pdf) to show lab (65\%) and field (35\%) data as stacked bars with clear legend differentiation.

\subsection{Comment 1.4: Cost data standardization}
\textbf{Reviewer comment:} "The cost data are sourced from different countries and years but lack adjustments for inflation and purchasing power parity. It is advisable to standardize the data to a common baseline year and discuss the impact of regional cost variations."

\textbf{Response:} We acknowledge this limitation and have added a new subsection discussing the challenges of cost comparisons across studies. We now explicitly state years for each cost estimate and acknowledge the lack of inflation adjustment as a limitation.

\textbf{Changes made:} Added discussion of cost analysis limitations in Section 6.5, including temporal and geographic variations in cost estimates.

\subsection{Comment 1.5: Figure clarity}
\textbf{Reviewer comment:} "In Figures 2 and 3, some data labels are obscured. A revision for improved clarity and visual presentation is suggested."

\textbf{Response:} We have revised these figures to improve clarity and prevent overlapping text.

\subsection{Comment 2.2: Sample size explanations}
\textbf{Reviewer comment:} "Figures (e.g., Fig 1) mention sample sizes and standard deviations, but fail to explain in detail the reasons for the differences in sample sizes among various enhancement strategies."

\textbf{Response:} We have added explanatory comments in the figure generation code and expanded the figure caption to explain sample size variations.

\textbf{Changes made:} Added comments in plot.py explaining that sample size differences reflect research maturity and implementation practicality (e.g., carbon supplementation has higher sample size due to easier laboratory implementation).

\subsection{Comment 2.3: Wood species discussion expansion}
\textbf{Reviewer comment:} "Different wood species also result in different denitrification performance. Please discuss more not just one research (4.2.2)"
