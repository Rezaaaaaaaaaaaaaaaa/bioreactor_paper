Enhancing Nitrate Removal in Denitrifying Woodchip Bioreactors: A Comprehensive Analysis of Enhancement Strategies and Environmental Trade-offs



Reviewer #1: The paper provides a systematic review of the enhancement strategies and environmental trade-offs of denitrifying woodchip bioreactors, covering various approaches such as carbon supplementation, alternative media, and bioaugmentation, along with an analysis of performance-influencing factors and economic costs. The research data are comprehensive, and the structure is clear, offering practical guidance for real-world applications. However, the following aspects require further improvement:
1.The authors mention that there is extensive existing research on woodchip bioreactors, but the novelty of this study is not sufficiently highlighted. It is recommended to clearly articulate the distinctive contributions that set this work apart from previous studies.
2.Section 2.1, "Literature Search and Screening Criteria," does not specify the time range of the literature search. This should be clarified.
3.Figure 1 combines laboratory and field data but does not differentiate or weight them. A direct comparative analysis between laboratory and field data in the figure is recommended.
4.The cost data are sourced from different countries and years but lack adjustments for inflation and purchasing power parity. It is advisable to standardize the data to a common baseline year and discuss the impact of regional cost variations.
5.In Figures 2 and 3, some data labels are obscured. A revision for improved clarity and visual presentation is suggested.
6.On page 7, lines 26-27 contain citation formatting errors. These should be corrected, and a full check of formatting issues throughout the manuscript is recommended.



Reviewer #2: The manuscript reviewed the woodchip denitrification bioreactor. Overall. I think the discussion is not insufficiency, and there are a lot of errors in the present review manuscript. The author should be carefully revised it before its publication.

1.Page 1, line 35. What is the alternative media?
2.Figures (e.g., Fig 1) mention sample sizes and standard deviations, but fail to explain in detail the reasons for the differences in sample sizes among various enhancement strategies. Adding such explanations would help improve the comparability of the data.
3.Different wood species also result in different denitrification performance. Please discuss more not just one research (4.2.2)
4.Page 5, line 38. Carbon supplementation (e.g., methanol) leads to a decline in hydraulic conductivity, but the specific impact of this decline on actual nitrate removal efficiency is not clearly quantified. Adding relevant quantitative analysis would help better understand the trade-offs of carbon supplementation
5.Page 17. The reference format should be consistent. The information is duplicated for the first reference on page 17
6.There are a lot of ? in the manuscript. Please check over the manuscript before its submission
7.Title for Figure 4: Data is clearly shown in the figure. There is no need to describe the data in the title.
8.Figure 5: Poor correlation between model and data
9.What did the author want to say from the Q10 OR θ
10.The economic analysis shows significant cost differences among different strategies ($10.56-$86/kg N), but a unified cost accounting standard is not explicitly defined. Supplementing a comparative framework for costs across different studies would facilitate more meaningful cost-effectiveness comparisons


Reviewer #3: The article reviews the factors influencing nitrate removal in woodchip reactors and their optimized designs. While the discussion covers comprehensive aspects—including carbon source origins, methods of mixed carbon source addition, their impacts on facilities, and cost analysis—each section merely presents data findings without detailed analysis of trends or in-depth exploration of underlying mechanisms. The discussion throughout remains simple, like a data compilation rather than offering substantive analytical insights. Additionally, there are other issues requiring modification here.
1. In the introduction, only four references are from the past five years, which may indicate that the background of the problem addressed lacks timeliness. The article should cite more recent publications. And the text mentions compiling data from 70 studies, but only 23 references are listed. Please provide the complete list of data sources and references.
2. The font in the Figures is too small to read.
3. There are some citation errors in the text (misplaced question marks). If additional references are cited here?
4. Page 6 Line 55: What specific standards constrain the use of high-tannin oak woodchips?




Reviewer #4: While the manuscript provides a broad overview of enhancement strategies for denitrifying woodchip bioreactors, I have several major concerns regarding its scientific rigor and presentation, which currently preclude its acceptance.
1. The review primarily presents a compilation of data from various studies without offering insightful analysis or synthesis. There is an absence of clear, evidence-based conclusions or overarching perspectives that would guide readers or advance understanding in this field.
2. Many sections rely on only one or two references, undermining the comprehensiveness and credibility of the review. Expanding the literature base and providing a more balanced assessment are necessary.
3. The manuscript contains numerous instances of improper referencing, such as the use of "[?]" instead of proper citations.
4. The final section on future research priorities is poorly structured, with unclear language and weak logical flow. This section should be revised substantially to offer coherent, actionable, and well-supported research directions.
 






Reviewer #1: This review synthesizes strategies to enhance nitrate removal of woodchip bioreactor, revealing tradeoffs like cost, operational complexity, and pollution swapping risks. This review is in line with aims and scope of the Journal of Water Process Engineering, but the following modifications are needed to meet the publishing requirements.
1. Abstract: As a review, the description of the experimental results cannot be said to be the author's analysis of the conclusions, but the need for more objective expression, the author needs to make changes.
2. Introduction: In fact, in addition to the solid carbon source as the electron transfer required for denitrification, the author also supplemented the promotion of denitrification by different inorganic electron donors and compared it with the denitrification reactor mentioned in this review.
3. 3.1 Denitrification Process and Limiting Factors: This part needs to add a denitrification mechanism diagram to describe denitrification more intuitively to the reader. In addition, the process of converting non-degradable carbon sources such as cellulose into glucose also needs to be given. At least it needs to explain after several links or reactions.
4. 4.1 Carbon Supplementation: It is well known that simple organic carbon sources are necessary substances for the denitrification process, and their addition can promote it. The author should give the necessity of supplementing organic carbon sources in the reactor. Is woodchip releasing carbon source too slowly? Or is too little released? Only by giving reasons in this way can the necessity of simple organic carbon source be introduced.
5. 4.2 Alternative Carbon Media: The author simply describes the effects of several different carbon sources, but does not compare them comprehensively.
6. 4.3 Mixed Media and Amendments: References need to be modified.
7. 5.2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions: The author should briefly give the output mechanism of nitrous oxide and methane.
8. 5.3 Phosphorus Dynamics: Does woodchip also release phosphate? The mechanism of phosphate removal in this type of reactor?
9. 7.1 Best Practices for Enhanced Systems: Is the hydraulic condition of the woodchip bioreactor also related to the material?
10. 9 Conclusions: The structure of the conclusion is not a simple list of data conclusions, but to summarize the key information and future research directions.



Reviewer #2: This is a well-written and comprehensive review paper that effectively summarizes the application of denitrifying bioreactors. The manuscript is well-structured, and the flow of information is clear and easy to follow. It provides a valuable synthesis of various retrofitting and modification strategies across different implementation scales and offers important insights into the current state and future potential of this technology.

However, there are some minor formatting issues related to figures and references that should be carefully reviewed and corrected by the authors.

Review Comments:

Page 2, line 18: Agreed that the nitrate concentration can influence the removal rate, but I believe the authors should also discuss the importance of bioavailable carbon concentration.

Page 2, line 20: About the variable flow conditions, can authors specify the range?

Page 2, line 23: Can authors provide any specific numbers about removal rate after 15 years of application?

Page 3, line 59-60: Can the authors clarify what is considered a "high" inlet concentration? For example, is it above 1, 5, or 10 mg/L?

Page 4, line 5: For the denitrification equation, did the authors account for biomass synthesis? Not all the carbon (glucose, in this case) is used for energy generation and some is used for microbial growth.

Page 4, line 37: Similar to my earlier comment, can the authors provide specific removal rate data after 7-15 years?

Page 6, figure 2: In the left diagram, the legend of "4601 m/day" overlaps with the title. Please adjust the formatting

Page 6, line 27: Reference format? Page 6, line 34-35: I am confused about why the removal rate decreases with increasing temperature in this case. Can authors clarify the underlying mechanism or provide supporting explanation?

Page 6, line 52-55: Is there an explanation for the differing behaviors among woodchip species? Could this be related to differences in carbon quality, lignocellulosic structure, or other material properties?

Page 7, line 26-27: Reference format?

Page 9, figure 7: Are there any associated nitrate concentrate data? I think the nitrate concentration also plays an important role governing the removal rate.

Page 10, line 33: The discussion focuses on adsorption-based phosphorus removal. However, there is also a lot of research on biological P removal in denitrifying bioreactors. I suggest including this aspect to provide a more comprehensive overview.
